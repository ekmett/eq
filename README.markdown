This package provides a data type that witnesses equality between two types using Leibnizian equality.

It includes a [refinement to the notion of Leibnizian equality by Oleg Kiselyov](http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2010-May/077177.html)
that permits it to refine equality using the injectively of type constructors via type families.
