next [????.??.??]
-----------------
* Allow building with GHC 9.0.

4.2 [2018.04.24]
----------------
* Make `lower`, `lower2`, and `lower3` in `Data.Eq.Type` poly-kinded.
* Introduce the `Data.Eq.Type.Hetero` module, which exposes `(:==)`, a
  heterogeneously kinded version of `(:=)`. This module is only available
  on GHC 8.2 and later.

4.1
---
* Add `TestEquality` and `TestCoercion` instances for `(:=)`.
* Add `fromLeibniz` and `toLeibniz` functions for converting between `(:~:)`
  (from `Data.Type.Equality`) and `(:=)`.
* Add a `reprLeibniz` function to convert `(:=)` to a `Coercion`
  (i.e., representational equality).
* Make `(:=)` a newtype.
* We can remove the `Trustworthy` claim and infer as `Safe` on modern GHCs.

4.0.2
-----
* Made := kind polymorphic.

4.0.1
-----
* Provided an explicit nominal `RoleAnnotation`.

4.0
---
* Updated to work with `semigroupoids` 4.0

3.1.1
-----
* Claim to be `Trustworthy`

3.1
---
* Disabled observing injectivity through `TypeFamilies` for GHC >= 7.6

3.0.1
-----
* Updated build system
* Removed my personal intra-package dependency upper bounds
* Added `README` and `CHANGELOG`
